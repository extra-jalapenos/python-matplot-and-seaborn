What Is Pandas?\n","\n","Pandas is a Python library that primarily adds two new datatypes to Python: `DataFrame` and `Series`.\n","\n","- A `Series` is a sequence of items, where each item has a unique label (called an `index`).\n","- A `DataFrame` is a table of data. Each row has a unique label (the `row index`), and each column has a unique label (the `column index`).\n","- Note that each column in a `DataFrame` can be considered a `Series` (`Series` index).\n","\n","Behind the scenes, these datatypes use the NumPy (\"Numerical Python\") library.\n","\n","NumPy primarily adds the `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) datatype to Pandas. An `ndarray` is similar to a Python list — it stores ordered data. However, it differs in three respects:\n"," - Each element has the same datatype (typically fixed-size, e.g., a 32-bit integer).\n"," - Elements are stored contiguously (immediately after each other) in memory for fast retrieval.\n"," - The total size of an `ndarray` is fixed.\n","\n","Storing `Series` and `DataFrame` data in `ndarray`s makes Pandas faster and uses less memory than standard Python datatypes.\n","\n","Many libraries (such as scikit-learn) accept `ndarray`s as input rather than Pandas datatypes, so we will frequently convert between them.\n","\n","\n","### 1.1 Using Pandas\n","\n","Pandas is frequently used in data science because it offers a large set of commonly used functions, is relatively fast, and has a large community. Because many data science libraries also use NumPy to manipulate data, you can easily transfer data between libraries.\n","\n","Pandas is a large library that typically takes a lot of practice to learn. It heavily overrides Python operators, resulting in odd-looking syntax. For example, given a `DataFrame` called `cars` which contains a column `mpg`, we might want to view all cars with mpg over 35. To do this, we might write: `cars[cars['mpg'] > 35]`. In standard Python, this would most likely give a syntax error.\n","\n","Pandas also highly favors certain patterns of use. For example, looping through a `DataFrame` row by row is highly discouraged. Instead, Pandas favors using **vectorized functions** that operate column by column. This is because each column is stored separately as an `ndarray`, and NumPy is optimized for operating on `ndarray`s."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OkXQ6hNqs36H"},"source":["### 1.2 Viewing Documentation\n","\n","There are a few ways to find more information about a method.\n","\n","In Jupyter, you can quickly view documentation for a method by following the method name by a `?`, as follows:\n","\n","```\n","users.head?\n","```\n","\n","```\n","Signature: users.head(n=5)\n","Docstring: Returns first n rows\n","```\n","\n","The `?` is a shortcut for the built-in Python function `help`, which returns the method's docstring. For example:\n","```\n","help(users.head)\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M2cDC1YJs36H"},"source":["### 1.3 Class Methods and Attributes\n","\n","Pandas `DataFrame`s are Pandas class objects and therefore come with attributes and methods. To access these, follow the variable name with a dot. For example, given a `DataFrame` called `users`:\n","\n","```\n","- users.index       # accesses the `index` attribute -- note there are no parentheses. attributes are not callable\n","- users.head()      # calls the `head` method (since there are open/closed parentheses)\n","- users.head(10)    # calls the `head` method with parameter `10`, indicating the first 10 rows. this is the same as:\n","- users.head(n=10)  # calls the `head` method, setting the named parameter `n` to have a value of `10`.\n","```\n","\n","We know that the `head` method accepts one parameter with an optional name of `n` because it is in the documentation for that method. Let's see how to view the documentation next."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":442,"status":"ok","timestamp":1717696737241,"user":{"displayName":"Simran

data or as a byproduct of manipulations. It is very important to detect missing data. Missing data can:\n","\n","- Make the entire row ineligible to be training data for a model.\n","- Hint at data-collection errors.\n","- Indicate improper conversion or manipulation.\n","- Actually not be missing — it sometimes means \"zero,\" \"false,\" \"not applicable,\" or \"entered an empty string.\"\n","\n","For example, a `.csv` file might have a missing value in some data fields:\n","\n","```\n","tool_name,material,cost\n","hammer,wood,8\n","chainsaw,,\n","wrench,metal,5\n","```\n","\n","When this data is imported, \"null\" values will be stored in the second row (in the \"material\" and \"cost\" columns).\n","\n","In Pandas, a \"null\" value is either `None` or `np.NaN` (Not a Number). Many fixed-size numeric datatypes (such as integers) do not have a way of representing `np.NaN`. So, numeric columns will be promoted to floating-point datatypes that do support it. For example, when importing the `.csv` file above:\n","\n","- **For the second row:** `None` will be stored in the \"material\" column and `np.NaN` will be stored in the \"cost\" column. The entire \"cost\" column (stored as a single `ndarray`) must be stored as floating-point values to accommodate the `np.NaN`, even though an integer `8` is in the first
